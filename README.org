** Requirements
- Hugo Version 0.85.0 or higher
    - *Hugo extended version is required*.
** Installation
*** Create a new website from scratch
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  hugo new site myportfolio
  cd myportfolio
  git init
  git submodule add https://github.com/Binary-Eater/hugo-theme-ghci.git themes/hugo-theme-ghci
  hugo server -t hugo-theme-ghci -w -D
#+END_SRC
*** Apply to an existing site
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd myportfolio
  git submodule add https://github.com/Binary-Eater/hugo-theme-ghci.git themes/hugo-theme-ghci
  hugo server -t hugo-theme-ghci -w -D
#+END_SRC
*** How to use theme
~hugo-theme-ghci~ supports the [[https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh][Mayccoll/Gogh]] theme
1. Choose a Goph theme : you can choose a theme [[https://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh/][here]].
2. Copy the name of the theme you selected
3. Configure your config.toml as follows
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
     [Params.Prompt]
     scheme = "THEME_NAME"
   #+END_SRC
** Configuration
in [[file:config/_default/config.toml][config.toml]]

#+BEGIN_SRC toml
  [Params]
  # Note: This is for the meta description, which is different from the
  # "description" displayed in the prompt.
  description = "Kevin Hammond's Portfolio!"
    [Params.Prompt]
    # Note: color scheme
    # Note: You can choose between
    # Note: hugo-theme-ghci original: ["Haskell"]
    # Note: hugo-theme-ghci built-in (inherited from hugo-theme-shell):
    #           ["prompt-powershell", "prompt-ubuntu", "prompt-retro", "prompt-white"]
    # Note: gogh theme: https://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh/
    scheme = "Haskell"

    # Note: speed at which text is displayed on the prompt
    # Note: if set to 0, typing animation will be disabled
    # Note:

    # Note: and set "math: true" at front matter in your Markdown or Org file
    headingDelay = 0 # GHCi heading speed : GHCi, version [ghcVersion]: [ghcURL]  :? for help

    contentDelay = 0 # content speed : content in .md file

    # Note: variables that control timing with regards to dynamic scrolling as the
    # prompt is updated
    # Note: these variables should not need to be tuned most likely (in-place due
    # to poor dynamic scrolling implementation due to limitations of more ideal
    # functionality like scrollIntoView + dynamically rendered elements)
    #
    # Note: units are in milliseconds
    #
    # Note: a FIXME comment is in place for this functionality. Once fixed, these
    # variables will be deprecated.
    scrollDownUpdateInterval = 50 # Controls the interval duration between scroll to bottom calls
    scrollDownTimeoutAfterTypeEffect = 500 # Controls time after typing effect is done to cancel subsequent scroll down calls

    [Params.Package] 
    # Note: controls properties related to the Haskell "module" that contains
    # functions with information about the site and profile
    importPackage = "Site" # module name
    importQualified = false # whether module should be a qualified import

    [Params.Profile]
    # Note: in output
    # ghci> [sysInfoFcnName]
    # Login name: [userName]
    # Host name: [pcName]

    #
    userName = "khammond"
    pcName = "glasgow"
    sysInfoFcnName = "getSystemInfo"
    profileDescriptionFcnName = "getProfileDescription"

    # Note: If you want to use a Markdown or Org file, you can use the following
    # description = "/description.md"
    # Note: and put the description.md in /content/description.md
    description = """

    Nice to meet you!

** Troubleshooting
- Hugo build fails
  - What is the version of your Hugo?
  - GHCi theme requires Hugo version 0.85.0 or higher and *extended version*
- Post does not show up (return 404 not found)
  - There are two possible causes for this.
    1. Forgot to add ~-D~ (~--buildDrafts~) as an argument to the hugo command
    2. The front matter of the post's ~.md~ or ~.org~ file has "draft: true"
       set.
